/**
 * Core class for the IBM Model 2 Translation system. Learns translation probabilities and
 * alignment probabilities from a corpus of weakly aligned sentences. In this model, an alignment
 * probability is introduced, a(i | j,l,m), which predicts a source word position, given its
 * aligned target word's position.
 *
 * EM Breakdown:
 *      E - Step: In training collect following counts weighted by training data:
 *                  a) Number of times a source word is translated into a target word
 *                  b) Number of times a particular position in source is aligned to a particular
 *                     position in target.
 *
 *      M - Step: Estimate new probabilities from E - Step counts.
 *
 * Variables:
 *      i - Position in the source sentence { 0 (NULL), 1, 2, ... Length }
 *      j - Position in the target sentence { 1, 2, ... Length }
 *      l - Number of words in the source sentence (excluding NULL)
 *      m - Number of words in the target sentence
 *      s - Word in the source language
 *      t - Word in the target language
